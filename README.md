# sarahGUI
I hate GUI, so one day I decided to write some elements once and for all.

Feel free to try to use it, I'm building this on linux.

## Note:
All sources build into a single testing application where I test out the elements. See `Application::run()` for those. The library itself doesn't rely on `Application`, though. 

## Building:
Just run `make all` in the root directory to build. `make run` has target `all` and also executes the binary located in `bin/`

## Future plans:
* Windows executable build target.
