# sarahGUI
I hate GUI, so one day I decided to write some elements once and for all.

Feel free to try to use it, I'm building this on linux.

## Note:
All sources build into a single testing application where I test out the elements. See `Application::run()` for those. The library itself doesn't rely on `Application`, though.
