I hate G\+UI, so one day I decided to write some elements once and for all.

Feel free to try to use it, I\textquotesingle{}m building this on linux.

\subsection*{Note\+:}

All sources build into a single testing application where I test out the elements. See {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_application_a8cf8941c8db90117d3735bce5ae1fdf4}{Application\+::run()}}} for those. The library itself doesn\textquotesingle{}t rely on {\ttfamily \mbox{\hyperlink{class_application}{Application}}}, though.

\subsection*{Building\+:}

Just run {\ttfamily make all} in the root directory to build. {\ttfamily make run} has target {\ttfamily all} and also executes the binary located in {\ttfamily bin/}

\subsection*{Future plans\+:}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Windows executable build target.
